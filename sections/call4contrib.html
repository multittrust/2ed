          <p>You are kindly invited to participate in our workshop with or without submission. However, as the idea of
            the workshop is to create a community, we highly advise you to submit a short paper containing your
            current, past or future work on one of the topics mentioned above.
            The contributions can be work in progress, extended abstracts, summary of previous research, or
            breakthrough ideas that would enrich our discussions during the workshop.
            Submissions will be anonymised, peer-reviewed and selected based on relevance and quality of writing. In
            case there are too many submissions, we will also give preference to a varied programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon acceptance, at least 1 author should attend the workshop in person and be ready to do a short
            presentation (lighting talk of approx. 7 minutes). On rejection, you are also welcome to still join our
            workshop. To attend the workshop, participants must be registered for HHAI conference.
