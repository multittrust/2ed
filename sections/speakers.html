          <h3>Understanding Human-Robot Trust during High-Risk Emergencies</h3>
          <p>

            This talk presents our ongoing effort to understand how and why people respond to faulty guidance from error prone robots during simulated high-risk emergencies.  We will present our recent attempts to understand and predict how people react to evacuation directions given by a robot during an emergency and how they calibrate their trust in the robot. Results from both in-person and virtual reality experiments provide evidence demonstrating that, in certain conditions, people will trust a robot too much, the role that anthropomorphism plays, and cues that predict who will overtrust a robot. Our results have implications for the use of robots in high-risk situations and foreshadow future issues that will need to be addressed. We also consider the ethical implications of creating emergency evacuation robots and present a set of ethical guidelines for developing evacuation robots. The talk will conclude by presenting avenues and motivations for future research.</p>
